# What's Boquila

A lot of websites have a bunch of bloat and fake stuff. So let's say just what's true about Boquila.

We develop 2 pieces of software: BoquilaHUB and BoquilaVerse.

That's it.

AI for nature. Tech for nature. Tech for good. We want to decentralize and bring cost down to help protect the planet.
