# The code

Simple HTML, we do everything by hand. Vanilla everything. No deps outside of icons, fonts and other similar stuff.

Very minimal, simple, yet cute aestethics.

# What's Boquila

A lot of websites have a bunch of bloat and fake stuff. We want to be minimal so people can explore our website and get what they want easily.

# How to work

Don't make changes that I didn't ask, unless it's obvious it needs to change.

Reuse CSS a lot, about inlining CSS only if it's obvious that it will ONLY go there.

assets should go inlined, so it's easier to read in every .html what img goes where.
